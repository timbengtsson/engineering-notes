# IT Security Developer  (2025-2027)
 
In the spring of 2025, I began a vocational higher education program in [IT Security Development](https://ecutbildning.se/utbildningar/it-sakerhetsutvecklare/) in Halmstad, Sweden. I started this program to deepen my understanding of modern IT security and to strengthen my ability to design, secure, and maintain robust systems in an increasingly complex threat landscape. With a background in web development, I wanted to move closer to the intersection of software, infrastructure, and security. This program allows me to combine development skills with a structured, practical approach to cybersecurity, focusing on both prevention and real-world problem solving.<br>

Security is not an optional add-on to web development—it is foundational. Systems that cannot be trusted provide little real value. As society becomes increasingly digital, protecting against data breaches, ransomware, and other attacks is more important than ever.<br>

The program combines theory with hands on practice and covers everything from networks and operating systems to cloud infrastructure, automation, and risk analysis. A strong emphasis is placed on real-world scenarios, problem-solving, and industry-relevant tools and methods.<br>

Key areas of study include:<br>

- **Network Technology & Network Security**<br>
Secure network design, administration, vulnerabilities, intrusion methods, firewalls, and cloud security.

- **Operating System Security**<br>
Security hardening and administration of Windows, Windows Server, and Linux systems, including attack surfaces, configuration, and troubleshooting.

- **Scripting, Automation & Python**<br>
Automation and scripting using Bash, PowerShell, and Python to improve efficiency and security operations.

- **Virtualized & Cloud Infrastructure Security**<br>
Security in virtualized, hybrid, and cloud-based environments, including virtual networks, shared storage, and security administration.

- **Security Projects & Risk Analysis**<br>
Threat modeling, vulnerability management, risk analysis, policies, and security standards.

- **Business Communication & AI Support**<br>
Project work, communication, legal aspects, and improving workflows with AI-supported tools.

The program also includes a long industry internship (LIA), providing hands-on experience in real production environments, followed by a degree project, often conducted in collaboration with an external organization.
