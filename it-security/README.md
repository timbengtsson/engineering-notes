# IT-Security

This section contains my structured notes, experiments, and practical references related to IT security. <br>
It reflects my transition from web development toward security-focused engineering, with an emphasis on real-world systems, operational security, and secure design.

The goal is to understand *why* systems fail, *how* they are attacked, and *how* they should be designed, monitored, and defended.

## Summary

Security is a foundational aspect of modern software and infrastructure. <br>
Systems that cannot be trusted have limited value, regardless of features or performance.

These notes focus on: 
- Understanding attack surfaces and common vulnerabilities
- Applying security principles to software, infrastructure, and operations
- Detecting, responding to, and learning from security incidents
- Building a security mindset, with tools used deliberately and in context

The content is influenced by my studies as an **[IT Security Developer](../education/it-security_developer.md)**, hands-on labs, CTF-style exercises, and practical experience from development and operations.
