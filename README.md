# Engineering Notes 
## Development, Architecture, Security, and Systems Thinking
 
This repository contains structured notes, experiments, and practical work related to software engineering and IT security, including:

- Personal notes, summaries, and reflections
- Software and system architecture concepts
- Design principles and engineering best practices
- Hands-on experiments, labs, and small projects
- Security-focused exercises and CTF-style challenges
- Scripting and automation for systems and security tasks
- Networking, operating systems, and infrastructure fundamentals
- Tools, techniques, and workflows used in real-world environments

The goal is not to be polished or purely theoretical, but practical and transparent.<br>
Everything here reflects what I have actually studied, tested, broken, fixed, or automated. 


## Why this repository exists
- To structure my learning in IT security and scripting
- To demonstrate how I think and work
- To serve as a reference for myself and others
- To give employers and collaborators a concrete view of my skills and interests

This repository evolves continuously as I learn and refine my understanding.

## A little about me
I’m an experienced programmer turned IT-security student with a strong interest in:
- Defensive and offensive security
- Scripting and automation
- Networking and infrastructure
- Understanding why things break, not just how to fix them
- [AIs impact on society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
- And Rickrolling, apparently

I learn best by doing, documenting, and explaining.


## Practice Platforms
I actively practice hands-on IT security labs and challenges on the following platforms:

- **TryHackMe** – https://tryhackme.com/p/BugLord 


## Scope & Disclaimer
- These notes are written for learning purposes, and will evolve.
- Some content may be simplified, experimental, and/or very wrong.
- CTF writeups do not include solutions to active challenges.
- Don't do illegal things. That is very bad, most of the time.
