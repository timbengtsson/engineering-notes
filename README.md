# IT Security – Notes, Labs & CTF Writeups
It contains:

- Personal notes and summaries
- Hands-on labs
- CTF writeups
- Bash and PowerShell scripting
- Networking and security fundamentals
- Tools and techniques used in real-world scenarios

The goal is not to be polished or theoretical, but practical and transparent. <br>
Everything here reflects what I have actually studied, tested, broken, fixed, or automated.


## Why this repository exists
- To structure my learning in IT security and scripting
- To demonstrate how I think and work, not just what I’ve read
- To serve as a reference for myself and others
- To give employers and collaborators a concrete view of my skills and interests

This repository evolves continuously as I learn more.

## A little about me
I’m an experienced programmer turned IT-security student with a strong interest in:
- Defensive and offensive security
- Scripting and automation
- Networking and infrastructure
- Understanding why things break, not just how to fix them
- [AIs impact on society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
- And Rickrolling, apparently

I learn best by doing, documenting, and explaining.

## Practice Platforms
I actively practice hands-on IT security labs and challenges on the following platforms:
